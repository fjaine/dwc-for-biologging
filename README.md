# Darwin Core guidelines for biologging data

## Introduction

This repository contains guidelines for expressing biologging data (e.g. acoustic telemetry, GPS tracking) in Darwin Core. It is lead by the Data Standardization Working Group of the [International Bio-Logging Society (IBLS)](https://www.bio-logging.net). **The guidelines are a work in progress and not (yet) a TDWG recommendation**.

## Wiki
