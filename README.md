# Darwin Core guidelines for biologging data

## Introduction

This repository contains guidelines for expressing biologging data (e.g. acoustic telemetry, GPS tracking) in Darwin Core. It is lead by the Data Standardization Working Group of the [International Bio-Logging Society (IBLS)](https://www.bio-logging.net), in collaboration with IODE/OBIS, which funded [a workshop on animal tagging and tracking, 23-26 April 2018, Oostende, Belgium](http://iobis.org/2018/05/18/att/). **The guidelines are a work in progress and not (yet) a TDWG recommendation**.

## Wiki

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-for-biologging/wiki) for guidelines and use cases.
